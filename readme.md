# SuperJim 2021 

[SuperJim 2021](https://debbiect246.github.io/retrogame/) is a retrogame produced by team 8 - The Retronauts in the CI retrogame hackathon. 

We are a group of coders, Matt, Monika, Ed, Deborah -   team 8 in the  CI retro games hackathon, which took place in August 2021.  We used git hub projects [github projects](https://github.com/debbiect246/retrogame/projects)  to keep track of all the tasks we had to do to make this app and we used github collaboratively, creating a repo which we all contributed to.


This app recreates the Mario game with a twist! Mario was a popular platform game in the 1990s which was very popular with gamers.  [Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario#:~:text=The%20Super%20Mario%20games%20are%20typically%20in%20the,across%20platforms%20and%20atop%20enemies%20in%20themed%20levels) still is a popular game which is still played by gamers and features a character - Mario who has to avoid obstacles and rescue a character- once this is done the game ends.  In our game the central character is a student of code institute and he has to collect 6 coins which represent projects needed to pass the course.  Along the way there are "baddies" who try to stop this happening including examples of bad code!  The character has won the game when he has got through to the end of the game having collected all 6 projects needed and having survived all levels.


## Wireframes

In order to have some basic structure in place and to be on the same page, we created the following wireframes for the game.  All wireframes were produced by Matt in either [balsamiq ](https://balsamiq.com/) - black and white images, or in [figma](https://www.figma.com/)- colour images.

1. [wireframes for the game instructions](/wireframes/home-page-instructions-modal.png).  
2. [wireframes for the home page](/wireframes/home-page.png).
3. [wireframes for style](/wireframs/style-details.png).
4. [wireframes for super-jim](/wireframes/super-jim.png).



   
## UX

### User stories

1. User wants to see Super Jim as the central character on the screen.
2. User wants Super Jim to avoid baddies to collect 6 coins which represent project.
3. User wants Super Jim to move up levels of increasing difficulty.
4. User wants a points system for scoring points.
5. User wants an instruction screen explaining how game works.

## Design features

* Start screen 
* Instructions screen
* Play button
* Platform game screen with background and Super Jim character


## Technologies Used

* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) or Hypertext markup language. HTML is used to create the structure of web pages.  It consists of tags which tell the browser how to set out text and images on the page. Hypertext is the method by which you move  around on the web, markups are the tags which set out the structure of the webpage, thus HTML is a language for web creation with  its own structure and syntax. The data in the tags is read by the web browser enabling you to create any web page you like. In 
this project my templates are all written in HTML. There is a template for adding, deleting, editing and adding recipes as well  as one for viewing information about each island. The base template sets out the way in which the website should look and information from this is used in each of the other templates.

* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/) stands for Cascading Style sheets which is a type of style language which sets out how the webpage should be styled. It allows the user to style the webpage in a particular way, making the UX richer and more meaningful for the user.

* [kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) is a javascript library for building games.

* We used [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) to work on the code. Chrome dev tools are a set of tools designed to give the developer tools to amend code in a testing environment in order to enhance the UX and functionality experience. 

* We used [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and gitpod [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) as our coding editors.  Lots of extensions  ere available to check the syntax of the code.


## Testing

Testing was carried out by human beings.  As each part of the game was being developed it was tested on screen checking that it worked and after it had been committed to the repo it was again tested by the person doing the commit to ensure that it worked as intended.


## Deployment

App was deployed to github pages. Game can be accessed [here](https://debbiect246.github.io/retrogame/) or by clicking on the game title at the start of this readme.

## Breakdown of steps involved in creating the app

We all worked in different ways but overall the process used by collaborators was as follows:

1. Debbie created a new github repo for the project.
2. Branches were created for Debbie, Matt, Ed and Monica and work was done on these branches and then pull requests made.  Pull requests were reviewed by other team members and merged when appropriate.
3. Team discussions were held about how to develop the game.  
4. Team coding sessions were done so that those people working on different parts of functionality for the game were able to ask further questions and get support in live time.
5.  A project board was created in github and team members were able to select cards to work on.  Matt spent some time on designing wireframes and assets for the game, Ed and Monica spent some time on the assets and scenes for the game and Debbie spent time setting up the repo, reviewing and merging some pull requests - other people could also do this for other team member's code.  Debbie also spent time updating the readme at regular intervals and coding the instruction screen and leaderboard.
6. Testing was done at regular intervals and the game reviewed during group discussions each day, usually starting around 8pm and going forward into the evening.
7.  We all had to learn kaboom js at the start as this was a new javascript library for all of us and then we went on to use it to generate ideas for the game and to create the relevant sprites, scenes and level.  Matt created the wireframes for everyone to work from.
8.  Once we had started on the initial process of creating the game, Debbie worked on the readme, keeping it up to date and monitoring the commits that were taking place as well as updating the hackathon app with details of the games' live link and github link.


  
## Future improvements

 1. Add further levels to the game.
 2. Add a leaderboard to the game so users can compare their scores with other users.
 3. Countdown timer could be added to the game.
 

## Credits

The [You tube video](https://youtu.be/4OaHB0JbJDI) we all used to get up to speed with using kaboom.js was produced by free code camp.


### Media  

Matt used [this colour palette from lospec.com](https://lospec.com/palette-list/endesga-64) for the design for the game.
Matt and  Ed used images from [the mushroomkingdom.net](https://themushroomkingdom.net/media/smb/wav) which were modified to create the character and objects used in the game.
