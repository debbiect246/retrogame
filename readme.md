# [Team 8](url of game)

We are a group of coders, Matt, Monika, Matt, Ed, Deborah -   team 8 in the  CI retro games hackathon, which is taking place in August 2021.  We used git hub projects [github projects](https://github.com/debbiect246/retrogame/projects)  to keep track of all the tasks we had to do to make this app and we used github collaboratively, creating a repo which we all contributed to.


This app recreates the Mario game with a twist! Mario was a popular platform game in the 1990s which was very popular with gamers.  [Mario] still is a popular game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario#:~:text=The%20Super%20Mario%20games%20are%20typically%20in%20the,across%20platforms%20and%20atop%20enemies%20in%20themed%20levels) which is still played by gamers and features a character - Mario who has to avoid obstacles and rescue a character- once this is done the game ends.  



## Wireframes

In order to have some basic structure in place and to be on the same page, we created [wireframes](/wireframes/wireframes.pdf)  and were working from these when creating our app.

   
## UX

### User stories

1.  User wants to see Mario as the central character on the screen.
1.  User wants Mario to avoid obstacles to achieve a goal.

## Design features

* Start screen 
* Instructions screen
* Play button
* Platform game screen with background and Mario character
* Site must be responsive and display well on different size screens.



## Technologies Used

* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) or Hypertext markup language. HTML is used to create the structure of web pages.  It consists of tags which tell the browser how to set out text and images on the page. Hypertext is the method by which you move  around on the web, markups are the tags which set out the structure of the webpage, thus HTML is a language for web creation with  its own structure and syntax. The data in the tags is read by the web browser enabling you to create any web page you like. In 
this project my templates are all written in HTML. There is a template for adding, deleting, editing and adding recipes as well  as one for viewing information about each island. The base template sets out the way in which the website should look and information from this is used in each of the other templates.

* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/) stands for Cascading Style sheets which is a type of style language which sets out how the webpage should be styled. It allows the user to style the webpage in a particular way, making the UX richer and more meaningful for the user.

* [jquery](https://jquery.com/) is used to simplify DOM manipulation. Jquery is a javascript library that is used to provide interactivity 
on websites. The $ sign signals to the browser that jquery is being used.

* [kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) is a javascript library for building games.

* We used [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) to work on my code. Chrome dev tools are a set of tools designed to give the developer tools to amend code in a testing environment in order to enhance the UX and functionality experience. 

* We used [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and gitpod [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) as our coding editors.  Lots of extensions  ere available to check the syntax of the code.


## Testing

Testing was carried out by human beings.

* Manual Testing

We tested each part of our user story to check it worked as expected.



## Deployment

App was deployed to github pages

## Breakdown of steps involved in creating the app

We all worked in different ways but overall the process used by collaborators was as follows:

1. One collaborator created a new github repo and initialised a local repo for the project.
2. An env file was created to hold passwords for the atlas  database   This file was put in .gitignore.
3. Each collaborator had to install the relevant files in order to be able to run flask in their local environment.
4. Each collaborator created a local branch to work on and created pull requests which were then merged into the project once they had been checked by other members of the team.
